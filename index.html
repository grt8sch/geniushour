  <article id="memory">Primary storage is the main storage known as RAM that stores the data and programs the CPU tells it to. 
    The two types of RAM are static and dynamic. 
    Static RAM is quicker but stores less. 
    Dynamic RAM stores more but is slower. 
    RAM is volatile which means it needs to be constantly re-energized otherwise it will lose all information. 
    This means that primary storage stores information used by only running programs as long as the computer is on. 
    The programs take up secondary storage when they are used or when the computer is shutdown. 
    This process is called von Neumann architecture.  
    John von Neumann was part of the team to create the first electronic computer and he is the one who came up with the von Neumann architecture.

  <article id="storage">Secondary storage is extra storage for a computer that is not volatile. 
    The secondary storage types are magnetic, optical, and integrated circuit. 
    Magnetic storage includes hard disks and floppy disks. 
    Hard disks are divided into multiple platters that take shape of a concentric circle which are divided into equal sections that make up a disk block. 
    Data is written and read in many blocks called clusters. 
    Optical storage is CDs and DVDs. 
    CDs and DVDs both have one track in the shape of a spiral. 
    CDs and DVDs are read from the inside to the outside. Integrated circuit (IC) storage consists of USB sticks, SD cards and hard drives. 
    IC storage can read and write data faster because it is static and does not move. 
    IC storage can break down after thousands to hundreds of thousands of use in transferring data.</article>
